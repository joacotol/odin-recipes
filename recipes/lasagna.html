		<p>This is a traditional dish in a Mexican family. It is composed of traditional Mexican ingredients layered over the top of one another in a lasagna-like fashion (hence the name) but has little similiarity to lasagna, so lasagna haters have no fear!</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>

			<li>1.5 pounds of ground beef</li>
			<li>1/4 cup water</li>
			<li>1 oz. packet of taco seasoning mix</li>
			<li>12 (8 inch) flour tortillas, or more if needed</li>
			<li>1 (14 ounce) can refried beans</li>
			<li>3 cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
			<li>1 (8 ounce) jar taco sauce</li>
			<li>1 cup shredded cheese</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>
